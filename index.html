                <p>Hey there! <b>My name is Nikki</b>, and I am a sophomore majoing in <b>Computer Science</b>, with a track in Data Science 
                    at the <b>University of Maryland, Baltimore County</b>. I enjoy programming in my free time, as it allows me to 
                    burn off some of my creative steam and exercise my problem solving skills. Some of my hobbies include <b>drawing, playing guitar, 
                    watching anime, weightlifting</b>, and <b>thrifting</b>. I hope to pursue <b>software engineering</b> in the future.</p>

                    <p>I have worked as a research assistant for the <b class = "pinkText">Data and Semantics Research Group at UMBC</b>. Through the transformation of raw quantitative data 
                    captured by decibel, degree, and motion sensors into human-comprehensible notions, such as noise level, temperature, and occupancy level, 
                    we are capable of determining the most optimal work location for users based on their comfortability preferences. I presented our findings at
